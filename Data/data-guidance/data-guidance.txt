Key stage 4 performance
2022/23 Academic year

Description

This data covers the GCSE results of pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 (KS4) in 2022/23. The data covers the main headline measures of:

- Progress 8
- Attainment 8
- Percentage of pupils achieving 9-5 in English and maths
- Percentage of pupils entering the English Baccalaureate
- EBacc Average Points Score (EBacc APS)

The data also covers numerous additional measures, depending on the level of data you are looking at.

The publication methodology should be referenced alongside this data. It provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality, as well as explaining methodology used in producing the data.

Coverage

This data covers the GCSE results of pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 (KS4) in 2022/23. The data is split by establishment type, as well as some data being split by pupil characteristics such as disadvantage status, free school meal status, special educational needs status and ethnicity. The data covers statistics at national, local authority, local authority district and parliamentary constituency level.

File formats and conventions

The data is rounded to either 1 or 2 decimal places, depending on which measure you are looking at. Some of the raw data totals go up to 3 decimal places. No suppression has been applied.

Footnotes:

1. All schools include state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision. Since September 2013, general further education colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14 to 16 year-olds. 2014/15 was the first year in which colleges have pupils at the end of key stage 4. From 2016 onwards, entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools.
2. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
3. State-funded mainstream schools include academies, free schools, city technology colleges and further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds. They exclude  state-funded special schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools and alternative provision (including pupil referral units, AP free schools and AP academies as well as state-funded AP placements in other institutions). Further education colleges with 14-16 provision are included in the total figure for all state-funded schools but not in the breakdowns by religious character or school admissions; therefore, figures by religious character or school admissions will not add up to the figure for all state-funded mainstream schools.
4. Local authority (LA) maintained mainstream schools include community schools, voluntary aided schools, voluntary controlled schools and foundation schools. Schools fully or partially under local authority control that are state-funded, mainly by the Dedicated Schools Grant.
5. All State-funded special schools include community special schools, foundation special schools, special sponsored academies, special converter academies and special free schools.
6. All independent schools include non-maintained special schools, independent special schools and independent schools.
7. State-funded special schools include local authority maintained special schools, academy sponsor led special schools, academy special schools and special free schools. They exclude independent special schools and non-maintained special schools.
8. Hospital, PRU & AP schools include Community Hospital School, Foundation Hospital School, Pupil Referral Unit, sponsored academies, convertor academies, free school and alternative provision.
9. Academies and free schools include sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs).
10. Most secondary schools educate pupils from year 7 (age 11 to 12) to year 11 (age 15 to 16). Some schools and colleges, such as university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools or further education colleges with key stage 4 provision, differ in their age range and specialisms and this should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance tables data for these types of provision. For example, Progress 8 measures the progress made by pupils from the end of year 6 (end of primary school) through to the end of year 11, covering a period of five years. In UTCs, studio schools and some other academies, pupils typically start in year 10, rather than in year 7 as is the case for most secondary schools. This means that, by the end of year 11, pupils in these schools will have typically attended that school for only 2 years, compared to 5 years for pupils in most secondary schools. As a result, the Progress 8 data for these schools is not directly comparable with the Progress 8 data for other schools. UTCs, studio schools and some FE colleges with KS4 provision provide a specialist technical and professional education. The government’s position is that it is not appropriate to expect the same rates of EBacc entry from these types of provision and that each school should decide on a case by case basis whether its specialist curriculum is compatible with the full EBacc.
11. Selective schools admit pupils wholly or mainly with reference to ability. These schools are formally designated as grammar schools.
12. Non selective schools in highly selective areas: Includes all non-selective schools in local authorities with a high level of selection (where 25% or more of state-funded secondary places are in state-funded selective schools). These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral.
13. Non selective schools in other areas: Includes all non-selective schools that are not in highly selective areas, including those in areas with some selection.
14. Religious character is taken from the GIAS (Get information about schools) website and is the legal designation of each school. Any state-funded mainstream schools who do not have their religious character recorded on the GIAS website are recorded in 'no religious character'. Religious character is taken from GIAS and are given as at 12 September at the start of the academic year, and is the legal designation of each school.
15. Since September 2013, general further education (FE) colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14- to 16-year-olds. Entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools. As FE colleges do not complete the school census, pupils at the end of key stage 4 attending FE colleges are included in the all pupils lines but not in the majority of the characteristics breakdowns. Therefore, there are some cases where the individual characteristics breakdowns will not add up to the all pupils figure. Pupils in FE colleges are included in the free school meals and disadvantaged figures from 2015/16 onwards.
16. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
17. z = When an observation is not applicable
18. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
19. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
20. In 2020 and 2021  Progress 8 data was not published because of the cancellation of GCSE exams (due to COVID-19). Calculating Progress 8 has an element of modelling (estimating the average Attainment 8 score for pupils with similar prior attainment) and with the lack of exam data, the Progress 8 measure is not meaningful as a measure of Progress. Progress 8 was reintroduced from 2022.
21. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average. Progress 8 scores should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the group achieves greater than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant. If the upper bound is negative, this means that the group achieves lower than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant.
22. EBacc sciences includes the double award GCSE in combined science, and single GCSEs in biology, chemistry, physics and computer science.
23. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
24. The open element contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
25. Average number of slots filled that contains U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.
26. Subjects included in the 'entered art' indicator include: Applied Art and Design, Art and Design, Drama, Media/Film/TV, Music, Dance and Performing Arts.

For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
6. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
7. Includes all converter academies that were open before 12 September of the academic year.
8. Includes academies and LA maintained schools that were open before 12 September of the academic year and had pupils at the end of key stage 4.
9. One academic year is between 12th September of one year to the 11th September the following year.

Footnotes:

1. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
2. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
3. z = When an observation is not applicable
4. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
5. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
6. EBacc sciences includes the double award GCSE in combined science, and single GCSEs in biology, chemistry, physics and computer science.
7. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
8. The open element contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
9. Average number of slots filled that contains U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.
10. Local authority, region and the total (state-funded sector) figures cover achievements in state-funded schools only. They do not include pupils recently arrived from overseas and so will not match with state-funded figures in the national tables. 'England' includes all pupils from state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
11. City of London does not have any state funded secondary schools, therefore there are no entries present in the data for this local authority.
12. In 2019, two new local authorities were created from a merger of others. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole was created on 1 April 2019 from areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, and the district of Christchurch. Dorset was created on 1 April 2019 from the districts of Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years.
13. In 2021, two new local authorities were introduced (North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire) which replaced Northamptonshire.
14. In 2023, two new local authorities were introduced (Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness) which replaced Cumbria.
15. Gateshead district boundary was changed in 2014. The local authority district code was changed from E08000020 to E08000037 to reflect this.

Footnotes:

1. All schools include state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision. Since September 2013, general further education colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14 to 16 year-olds. 2014/15 was the first year in which colleges have pupils at the end of key stage 4. From 2016 onwards, entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools.
2. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
3. State-funded mainstream schools include academies, free schools, city technology colleges and further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds. They exclude  state-funded special schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools and alternative provision (including pupil referral units, AP free schools and AP academies as well as state-funded AP placements in other institutions). Further education colleges with 14-16 provision are included in the total figure for all state-funded schools but not in the breakdowns by religious character or school admissions; therefore, figures by religious character or school admissions will not add up to the figure for all state-funded mainstream schools.
4. All State-funded special schools include community special schools, foundation special schools, special sponsored academies, special converter academies and special free schools.
5. All independent schools include non-maintained special schools, independent special schools and independent schools.
6. State-funded special schools include local authority maintained special schools, academy sponsor led special schools, academy special schools and special free schools. They exclude independent special schools and non-maintained special schools.
7. Hospital, PRU & AP schools include Community Hospital School, Foundation Hospital School, Pupil Referral Unit, sponsored academies, convertor academies, free school and alternative provision.
8. Academies and free schools include sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs).
9. Most secondary schools educate pupils from year 7 (age 11 to 12) to year 11 (age 15 to 16). Some schools and colleges, such as university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools or further education colleges with key stage 4 provision, differ in their age range and specialisms and this should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance tables data for these types of provision. For example, Progress 8 measures the progress made by pupils from the end of year 6 (end of primary school) through to the end of year 11, covering a period of five years. In UTCs, studio schools and some other academies, pupils typically start in year 10, rather than in year 7 as is the case for most secondary schools. This means that, by the end of year 11, pupils in these schools will have typically attended that school for only 2 years, compared to 5 years for pupils in most secondary schools. As a result, the Progress 8 data for these schools is not directly comparable with the Progress 8 data for other schools. UTCs, studio schools and some FE colleges with KS4 provision provide a specialist technical and professional education. The government’s position is that it is not appropriate to expect the same rates of EBacc entry from these types of provision and that each school should decide on a case by case basis whether its specialist curriculum is compatible with the full EBacc.
10. Selective schools admit pupils wholly or mainly with reference to ability. These schools are formally designated as grammar schools.
11. Non selective schools in highly selective areas: Includes all non-selective schools in local authorities with a high level of selection (where 25% or more of state-funded secondary places are in state-funded selective schools). These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral.
12. Non selective schools in other areas: Includes all non-selective schools that are not in highly selective areas, including those in areas with some selection.
13. Religious character is taken from the GIAS (Get information about schools) website and is the legal designation of each school. Any state-funded mainstream schools who do not have their religious character recorded on the GIAS website are recorded in 'no religious character'. Religious character is taken from GIAS and are given as at 12 September at the start of the academic year, and is the legal designation of each school.
14. Since September 2013, general further education (FE) colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14- to 16-year-olds. Entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools. As FE colleges do not complete the school census, pupils at the end of key stage 4 attending FE colleges are included in the all pupils lines but not in the majority of the characteristics breakdowns. Therefore, there are some cases where the individual characteristics breakdowns will not add up to the all pupils figure. Pupils in FE colleges are included in the free school meals and disadvantaged figures from 2015/16 onwards.
15. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
16. z = When an observation is not applicable
17. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
18. Any science includes Astronomy, Electronics, Environmental Science and Geology.
19. Only GCSEs and established GCSE equivalents (Cambridge International certificates and Edexcel level 1/2 certificates) are included in this data. Excludes Double Awards.
20. Discounting has been applied where pupils have taken the same subject more than once. In 2021/22, with the return of the exam series, first entry rules were reintroduced for discounting. Further information can be found in the secondary accountability guidance. For more on the discounting methodology read the Discounting and Early Entry Guidance.
21. Since 2014/15, the early entry policy where only a pupil’s first attempt at a qualification is counted in performance measures was extended to all subjects.
22. In 2017, new reformed GCSEs (which use the 9-1 grade scale) were introduced into secondary school performance tables in a phased approach. Unreformed subjects continued to be graded using the A* to G system. From 2020 onwards all GCSEs are now reformed and use the 9-1 grading scale.
23. Includes schools that were open before 12 September of the academic year.
24. Combined Science GCSE is a Double Award and is included in this table for the purpose of comparison with other Science subjects.
25. All entries and achievements are for AS levels and applied AS levels with the exception of the mathematics (FSMQ) category which covers all Free Standing Mathematics Qualifications.

Footnotes:

1. All schools include state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision. Since September 2013, general further education colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14 to 16 year-olds. 2014/15 was the first year in which colleges have pupils at the end of key stage 4. From 2016 onwards, entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools.
2. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
3. z = When an observation is not applicable
4. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
5. Discounting has been applied where pupils have taken the same subject more than once. In 2021/22, with the return of the exam series, first entry rules were reintroduced for discounting. Further information can be found in the secondary accountability guidance. For more on the discounting methodology read the Discounting and Early Entry Guidance.
6. Total number of entries include pupils who were absent, whose results are pending and results which are ungraded or unclassified.
7. Figures include attempts and achievements by these pupils in previous academic years where only the best grade in each individual subject is counted per pupil. Where subjects have been combined into a group (e.g. Other Modern Languages) and a pupil has two or more entries, each result in each subject is counted.
8. Since 2014/15, the early entry policy where only a pupil’s first attempt at a qualification is counted in performance measures was extended to all subjects.
9. In 2017, new reformed GCSEs (which use the 9-1 grade scale) were introduced into secondary school performance tables in a phased approach. Unreformed subjects continued to be graded using the A* to G system. From 2020 onwards all GCSEs are now reformed and use the 9-1 grading scale.
10. For pupils at the end of KS4 in 2022/23, where pupils achieved qualifications in subjects between January 2020 and August 2021, we will not use results from these qualifications and these results are shown as covid impacted. The entries into the qualifications are still counted.
11. Some percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.

For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
6. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.

Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
6. In 2020 and 2021  Progress 8 data was not published because of the cancellation of GCSE exams (due to COVID-19). Calculating Progress 8 has an element of modelling (estimating the average Attainment 8 score for pupils with similar prior attainment) and with the lack of exam data, the Progress 8 measure is not meaningful as a measure of Progress. Progress 8 was reintroduced from 2022.
7. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average. Progress 8 scores should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the group achieves greater than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant. If the upper bound is negative, this means that the group achieves lower than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant.
8. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years.

In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
9. The residency of 992 pupils living in England in 2022/23 is unknown due to missing or invalid postcode information. Pupils not resident in England and pupils with missing or invalid postcode information are excluded from the figures in presented.
10. The rural-urban classification of postcodes for 2023 are based on the 2011 classification of output areas released in August 2013. Census output areas forming settlements with populations of over 10,000 are defined as urban. The urban domain is further sub-divided into three broad morphological types based on the predominant settlement component. The remainder are defined as one of three rural types.
11. Income Deprivation Affecting Children Indices. Each SOA in England is given a score which ranks it between 1 and 32,844, 1 being the most deprived. The IDACI score is based off the 2011 classifications, but the pupil residency code is based off the 2021 census, so this has resulted in some pupils not being matched to an IDACI score. These are marked as unknown.
12. IDACI bands are based on the latest IDACI scores.

5. Local authority, region and the total (state-funded sector) figures cover achievements in state-funded schools only. They do not include pupils recently arrived from overseas and so will not match with state-funded figures in the national tables. 'England' includes all pupils from state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
6. Any science includes Astronomy, Electronics, Environmental Science and Geology.
7. Any Design and Technology includes Design and Technology Engineering and Product Design qualifications.
8. Only GCSEs and established GCSE equivalents (Cambridge International certificates and Edexcel level 1/2 certificates) are included in this data. Excludes Double Awards.
9. Grade U refers to pupils' results which are ungraded or unclassified.
10. Grade X refers to pupils who were absent or whose results are pending.
11. Discounting has been applied where pupils have taken the same subject more than once. In 2021/22, with the return of the exam series, first entry rules were reintroduced for discounting. Further information can be found in the secondary accountability guidance. For more on the discounting methodology read the Discounting and Early Entry Guidance.

'England' includes all pupils from state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
4. Pupils also registered at an institution normally included within the Secondary School Performance Tables (state funded mainstream schools) are excluded from the Alternative Provision data. This methodology was retained for attainment data in 2020 and 2021 even though the school performance tables were cancelled in those years.
5. Discounting has been applied where pupils have taken the same subject more than once. In 2021/22, with the return of the exam series, first entry rules were reintroduced for discounting. Further information can be found in the secondary accountability guidance. For more on the discounting methodology read the Discounting and Early Entry Guidance.
6. The subject totals do not sum to the overall total because some pupils enter more than one vocational subject. For example, a pupil that has entered both Art & Design and Business will appear in both the Art & Design and Business totals but will be counted only once in the overall total.

1. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
2. z = When an observation is not applicable
3. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
4. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
5. EBacc sciences includes the double award GCSE in combined science, and single GCSEs in biology, chemistry, physics and computer science.
6. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
7. The open element contains the three highest point scores in any three other subjects, including English language or literature (if not counted in the English slot), further GCSE qualifications (including English Baccalaureate subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list.
8. Average number of slots filled that contains U grades or other qualifications scoring 0 points are counted as a non-filled slot.
9. Local authority, region and the total (state-funded sector) figures cover achievements in state-funded schools only. They do not include pupils recently arrived from overseas and so will not match with state-funded figures in the national tables. 'England' includes all pupils from state-funded schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
10. City of London does not have any state funded secondary schools, therefore there are no entries present in the data for this local authority.
11. In 2019, two new local authorities were created from a merger of others. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole was created on 1 April 2019 from areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, and the district of Christchurch. Dorset was created on 1 April 2019 from the districts of Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years.
12. In 2021, two new local authorities were introduced (North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire) which replaced Northamptonshire.
13. In 2023, two new local authorities were introduced (Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness) which replaced Cumbria.
14. Pupils also registered at an institution normally included within the Secondary School Performance Tables (state funded mainstream schools) are excluded from the Alternative Provision data. This methodology was retained for attainment data in 2020 and 2021 even though the school performance tables were cancelled in those years.

7. English includes 'pupils whose first language is English’ includes 'not known but believed to be English'.
8. Other than English includes ‘pupils whose first language is other than English’ includes 'not known but believed to be other than English'.
9. Free school meals (FSM) does not relate to pupils who actually received free school meals but those who are eligible to receive free school meals. Pupils not eligible for free school meals or unclassified pupils are described as ‘All other pupils’.
10. Sub totals may not sum to the grand total due to a small number of pupils with missing information e.g. for FSM, SEN, EAL and those where ethnicity is not recorded.
11. From 2014/15, disadvantaged pupils include pupils known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children for at least one day or are adopted from care.  For 2013/14 and earlier years, they include pupils known to be eligible for FSM in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children.
12. Disadvantaged all other includes pupils for whom free school meal eligibility, Special Educational Needs status (SEN provision) or SEN primary need could not be determined.
13. 'No SEN' includes pupils whom could not obtained, refused, unclassified or could not be determined.
14. Statement/EHC plan indicates whether a pupil a pupil has a statement of SEN or an education, health and care (EHC) plan when a formal assessment has been made.
15. SEN support indicates whether a pupil has extra or different help given from that provided as part of the school’s usual curriculum. The class teacher and SEN coordinator (SENCO) may receive advice or support from outside specialists. This category replaces the former ‘school action’ and ‘school action plus’ categories.
16. 'Total' includes pupils for whom Free School Meal eligibility (FSM), Special Educational Needs status (SEN provision) or SEN primary need could not be determined. This figure also includes pupils at further education colleges: as FE colleges do not complete the school census, we do not have matched pupil characteristics data of pupils in FE colleges and therefore these pupils are not included in characteristics breakdowns. This means that there are some cases where the individual characteristics breakdowns will not add up to the all pupils figure.
17. Following special educational needs and disability (SEND) reforms in 2014/15, SEN pupils are categorised as 'SEN with a statement or Education, health and care (EHC) plan' and 'SEN support'. SEN support replaces 'school action' and 'school action plus' (grouped as SEN without a statement up to and including 2013/14) but some pupils remain with these provision types in first year of transition. More detailed information on the reforms can be found at this link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25
18. 'Any SEN' indicates whether a pupil has learning difficulties or disabilities that make it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age. This includes 'SEN with a statement 'EHC plan' or 'SEN support'.
19. 'No identified SEN' includes pupils whom could not  obtained, refused, unclassified or could not be determined.
20. Unclassified includes pupils whom ethnicity was not obtained, refused or could not be determined.

Footnotes:

1. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
2. State-funded mainstream schools include academies, free schools, city technology colleges and further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds. They exclude  state-funded special schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools and alternative provision (including pupil referral units, AP free schools and AP academies as well as state-funded AP placements in other institutions). Further education colleges with 14-16 provision are included in the total figure for all state-funded schools but not in the breakdowns by religious character or school admissions; therefore, figures by religious character or school admissions will not add up to the figure for all state-funded mainstream schools.
3. Local authority (LA) maintained mainstream schools include community schools, voluntary aided schools, voluntary controlled schools and foundation schools. Schools fully or partially under local authority control that are state-funded, mainly by the Dedicated Schools Grant.
4. All State-funded special schools include community special schools, foundation special schools, special sponsored academies, special converter academies and special free schools.
5. State-funded special schools include local authority maintained special schools, academy sponsor led special schools, academy special schools and special free schools. They exclude independent special schools and non-maintained special schools.
6. Academies and free schools include sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs).
7. Most secondary schools educate pupils from year 7 (age 11 to 12) to year 11 (age 15 to 16). Some schools and colleges, such as university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools or further education colleges with key stage 4 provision, differ in their age range and specialisms and this should be borne in mind when reviewing the performance tables data for these types of provision. For example, Progress 8 measures the progress made by pupils from the end of year 6 (end of primary school) through to the end of year 11, covering a period of five years. In UTCs, studio schools and some other academies, pupils typically start in year 10, rather than in year 7 as is the case for most secondary schools. This means that, by the end of year 11, pupils in these schools will have typically attended that school for only 2 years, compared to 5 years for pupils in most secondary schools. As a result, the Progress 8 data for these schools is not directly comparable with the Progress 8 data for other schools. UTCs, studio schools and some FE colleges with KS4 provision provide a specialist technical and professional education. The government’s position is that it is not appropriate to expect the same rates of EBacc entry from these types of provision and that each school should decide on a case by case basis whether its specialist curriculum is compatible with the full EBacc.
8. Selective schools admit pupils wholly or mainly with reference to ability. These schools are formally designated as grammar schools.
9. Non selective schools in highly selective areas: Includes all non-selective schools in local authorities with a high level of selection (where 25% or more of state-funded secondary places are in state-funded selective schools). These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral.
10. Non selective schools in other areas: Includes all non-selective schools that are not in highly selective areas, including those in areas with some selection.
11. Religious character is taken from the GIAS (Get information about schools) website and is the legal designation of each school. Any state-funded mainstream schools who do not have their religious character recorded on the GIAS website are recorded in 'no religious character'. Religious character is taken from GIAS and are given as at 12 September at the start of the academic year, and is the legal designation of each school.
12. Since September 2013, general further education (FE) colleges and sixth-form colleges have been able to directly enrol 14- to 16-year-olds. Entries and achievements for these pupils are included in figures as state-funded schools. As FE colleges do not complete the school census, pupils at the end of key stage 4 attending FE colleges are included in the all pupils lines but not in the majority of the characteristics breakdowns. Therefore, there are some cases where the individual characteristics breakdowns will not add up to the all pupils figure. Pupils in FE colleges are included in the free school meals and disadvantaged figures from 2015/16 onwards.
13. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
14. z = When an observation is not applicable
15. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
16. c = a cell that has been suppressed due to low number of pupils. Suppression was applied where deemed necessary for all data up to 2018/19. For 2019/20, DfE suppression policy changed. For 2020 and 2021 results where a geographical area contains only one school (for example Isles of Scilly) the data for that area has been suppressed. This is in line with the announcement that school level data would not be published using either summer 2020 or summer 2021 exam grades awarded. Data has not being supressed at local authority or national level from 2022 onwards.
17. In 2020 and 2021  Progress 8 data was not published because of the cancellation of GCSE exams (due to COVID-19). Calculating Progress 8 has an element of modelling (estimating the average Attainment 8 score for pupils with similar prior attainment) and with the lack of exam data, the Progress 8 measure is not meaningful as a measure of Progress. Progress 8 was reintroduced from 2022.
18. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average. Progress 8 scores should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the group achieves greater than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant. If the upper bound is negative, this means that the group achieves lower than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant.
19. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
20. English as an additional language (EAL) unclassified includes pupils whom first language was not obtained, refused or could not be determined.
21. English includes 'pupils whose first language is English’ includes 'not known but believed to be English'.
22. Other than English includes ‘pupils whose first language is other than English’ includes 'not known but believed to be other than English'.
23. Free school meals (FSM) does not relate to pupils who actually received free school meals but those who are eligible to receive free school meals. Pupils not eligible for free school meals or unclassified pupils are described as ‘All other pupils’.
24. Sub totals may not sum to the grand total due to a small number of pupils with missing information e.g. for FSM, SEN, EAL and those where ethnicity is not recorded.
25. From 2014/15, disadvantaged pupils include pupils known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children for at least one day or are adopted from care.  For 2013/14 and earlier years, they include pupils known to be eligible for FSM in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children.
26. Disadvantaged all other includes pupils for whom free school meal eligibility, Special Educational Needs status (SEN provision) or SEN primary need could not be determined.
27. 'No SEN' includes pupils whom could not obtained, refused, unclassified or could not be determined.
28. Statement/EHC plan indicates whether a pupil a pupil has a statement of SEN or an education, health and care (EHC) plan when a formal assessment has been made.
29. SEN support indicates whether a pupil has extra or different help given from that provided as part of the school’s usual curriculum. The class teacher and SEN coordinator (SENCO) may receive advice or support from outside specialists. This category replaces the former ‘school action’ and ‘school action plus’ categories.
30. All pupils with a primary need (from 2014/15 onwards this consisted of pupils flagged as SEN with a statement, EHC plan, SEN support).
31. 'Total' includes pupils for whom Free School Meal eligibility (FSM), Special Educational Needs status (SEN provision) or SEN primary need could not be determined.

Footnotes:

1. All state-funded schools include local authority maintained mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges, further education colleges with provision for 14 to 16 year-olds and state-funded special schools. They exclude independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision. Alternative provision includes academy and free school alternative provision.
2. Some zero percentages may represent small numbers due to rounding.
3. z = When an observation is not applicable
4. : = When data is unavailable for other reasons
5. In 2020 and 2021  Progress 8 data was not published because of the cancellation of GCSE exams (due to COVID-19). Calculating Progress 8 has an element of modelling (estimating the average Attainment 8 score for pupils with similar prior attainment) and with the lack of exam data, the Progress 8 measure is not meaningful as a measure of Progress. Progress 8 was reintroduced from 2022.
6. A Progress 8 score of 1.0 means pupils in the group make on average approximately a grade more progress than the national average; a score of -0.5 means they make on average approximately half a grade less progress than average. Progress 8 scores should be interpreted alongside the associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the group achieves greater than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant. If the upper bound is negative, this means that the group achieves lower than average progress compared to pupils in mainstream schools nationally and that this is statistically significant.
7. EBacc sciences includes the double award GCSE in combined science, and single GCSEs in biology, chemistry, physics and computer science.
8. Reformed GCSEs were introduced in phases for first examination between 2017 and 2020. The last phase of reformed GCSEs was first examined in 2022. This was due to the cancellation of exams and assessments in summer 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. All GCSEs now use the 9-1 grading system. Results for 2020 and 2021 are not comparable with earlier years due to the cancellation of exams (due to Covid-19) and changes to way GCSE grades were awarded in those years. GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading. Changes were made to the methodology for calculating performance data due to the commitment not to use qualification results awarded between January 2020 and August 2021 in future measures. In 2023 there was a return to pre-pandemic grading, with some protections.
9. Free school meals (FSM) does not relate to pupils who actually received free school meals but those who are eligible to receive free school meals. Pupils not eligible for free school meals or unclassified pupils are described as ‘All other pupils’.
10. Sub totals may not sum to the grand total due to a small number of pupils with missing information e.g. for FSM, SEN, EAL and those where ethnicity is not recorded.
11. From 2014/15, disadvantaged pupils include pupils known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children for at least one day or are adopted from care.  For 2013/14 and earlier years, they include pupils known to be eligible for FSM in any spring, autumn, summer, alternative provision or pupil referral unit census from year 6 to year 11 or are looked after children.
